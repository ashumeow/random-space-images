# Space images search-engine
Retrieving Images and Automatically saving various random beautiful space/astronomy images from a database server using Python 2.7.10
```
Different types of search mechanism:

1. Random search [working]
2. Keyword-based search [not-working at present]
```
```
Execution:

For random-search:

Run hubble.py using Git or Python interpreter or anything that runs Python.
This was tested Python 2.7.10 [Latest]
Note: Oh! Turn on your internet connection while trying it.
For picking random numbers, choose from 0 to 14. 
Currently, only 17 images are in the database.
Download image numbers start from 0. So it's 0 to 16 images at present.
Programmers/Developers love including 0, right? lol
Loading more images are in-progress. 
Sooner, I am aiming to load more than 1000 images if possible, not just from Hubble.

Run space-planets.py using Git or Python interpreter or anything that runs Python.
This was tested Python 2.7.10 [Latest]
Note: Oh! Turn on your internet connection while trying it.
For picking random numbers, choose from 0 to 1.
Currently, only 2 images are in the database.
Loading more images are in-progress. 
Sooner, I am aiming to load more images.
