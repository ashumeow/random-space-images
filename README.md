# random-space-images
Capturing, Retrieving and Automatically saving various random beautiful space/astronomy images from a database server using Python 2.7.10
```
Different types of search mechanism:

1. Random search [working]
2. Keyword-based search [not-working at present]

***
For picking random numbers, choose from 0 to 7. <br>
Currently, only 8 images are in the database. <br>
Download image numbers start from 0. So it's 0 to 7 images at present. <br>
Programmers/Developers love including 0, right? lol <br>
Loading more images are in-progress. <br>
Sooner, I am aiming to load more than 1000 images if possible, not just from Hubble.
***
```
Execution:

For random-search:
Run hubble.py using Git or Python interpreter or anything that runs Python.
I used Python 2.7.10 [Latest]. This works for any Python 2.7+ versions
Note: Oh! Turn on your internet connection while trying it.
```
<b>Release:</b>
There will be a release sooner with good enhancements. <br>
For now, this is a pre-release.
